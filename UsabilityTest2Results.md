# Introduction #

A second usability test was performed on March 7, 2011.  Five members of the WikiMap team met with six members of our customer group.  This document is a compilation of the feedback we received today.

# Impressions and Feedback #
  * Zooming in and out is confusing.  Users are unaware of what level they are at, and what the significance of different levels entail
  * Latency is a distracting aspect and should be taken care of in future references.
  * Manual testing needs to occur for edge case articles to make sure they are related.
  * Manual testing needs to occur for screen sizes and browser issues
  * Back and forward buttons of the browser are intuitive enough to navigate back and forth
  * Minimap as an interactive feature would be nice.

## Raw Data ##
## Task 1: Search for any topic you are curious about.  Tell us about your initial impression when your results load. ##

  * just have a single line at the top
  * image was missing
  * hover delay
  * is there background caching of nodes?
  * Zoom in/out is confusing
  * timer for hovering
  * 'tacos', 'fajitas' were both broken and didn't return a tree
  * capitization still seems off
  * ability to highlight on the outer frame of the page was distracting
  * aesthetically pleasing and the View Full Article is clear
  * are you sure we can use the Wikipedia Globe?

## Task 2: You see a series of rounded rectangles with topics spanning out from the center's main topic.  You want to get a summary of each.  How do you accomplish this? Was this sufficient? ##
  * hovering over the node - it's slow so making it faster will make the experience better
  * Wanted to move around the map with arrow keys, but couldn't.
  * yes but slow

## Task 3: The summary doesn't provide you all the details that you want.  What would you do next to get the rest of the information? ##
  * Click 'View Full Article' image, though it didn't stand out because they thought it was a part of the preview text
  * Design of the site was intuitive
  * Article title should be at the top of the page when you go into full article view
  * went to 'View Full Article'

## Task 4: There were other topics that interested you and you want to travel back to them.  How do you get back to the map of the related topics?  Did the design of the website prompt you to do this? ##
  * Back button
  * Yes, back and forward button
  * Consider having zoom out exploration from the main search
  * Expected Minimap to be interactive

## Task 5: Take a look at the other topics and click to forward to two other topics.  After which, navigate back to your original topic.  How did you do this and how was your experience? ##
  * Back button or node history would be nice. Scrollable or truncated

== Task 6: Search for a new topic.  You want to see more topics that are related to this topic that the map initially gives you.  How do you go about seeing more topics in the map, or to see less topics?
  * Middle node is distracting when you zoom in and out because it keeps refreshing and recentering
  * Some indication about what zoom level you're at is needed.

## Task 7: Please feel free to browse around the website.  Are there any additional comments, suggestions, questions? ##
  * The "did you mean" centering feels off
  * "Retrieved from"  - put a line down, make it a link similar to Google's source references.
  * No title shown in article view
  * Double click should zoom in.
  * Wiki article text too large, larger than the real wikipedia
  * Map doesn't fit on different screen sizes.  Need to test.
  * Map won't load for 'tacos' or 'fajitas'
  * Map won't load what seems like relevant articles for letters of the English alphabet
  * Latency is distracting
  * Search bar should be longer
  * Map part should occupy the entire width of the available area.
